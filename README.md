# sql-challenge

This is the SQL homework for the UTBootCamp. I wrote an ERD to get an idea of what the tables contained, then I imported data into a SQL database that I created. Then, I analyzed the data in SQL using joins, where clauses, and order bys. After that, I did the bonus project which involved importing my SQL database to Jupyter Notebook via sqlalchemy. I created a histogram of common salaries, then a bar graph of average salaries by title.
